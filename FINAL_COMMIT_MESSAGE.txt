fix(player): ensure playNext uses global playlist + fix ended->next flow

Root cause: Autoplay was not working because the player wasn't properly maintaining active playlist context when transitioning between songs.

Changes made:
- Added proper ActivePlaylist structure with id, tracks, currentIndex, repeatMode, shuffle
- Added activePlaylist state and ref to maintain context
- Enhanced setPlaylistAndPlay to properly create and set active playlist
- Fixed playNext to use refs and active playlist context
- Improved playSong to maintain active playlist state
- Added targeted debug logging throughout player lifecycle
- Verified audio ended event properly triggers autoplay flow
- Confirmed persistence works with active_playlist_v1 key

Testing:
- Verified list-origin play → ended → next plays
- Verified single-track play → ended stops
- Verified repeat one/all modes work
- Verified home-list play sets playlist and playNext works
- Verified localStorage persistence behavior

Acceptance criteria met:
✅ audio.ended triggers handleSongEnd() and that reliably causes next track to play when an active playlist has a next track
✅ Playing a song from Home / Playlist / Album / Search sets a global activePlaylist (with tracks[]) and currentIndex
✅ playNext() uses that global state
✅ If a song started from a single-track context (no list), behavior: stop at end unless repeatMode says otherwise
✅ Added logs that help trace: when a song starts, what activePlaylist is, currentIndex, what playNext() computes as next index/track
✅ Persistence (active_playlist_v1) behavior unchanged

Files changed:
- src/context/MusicContext.tsx: Main player context with all fixes
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout player lifecycle
- Cleaned up excessive console.log statements, kept key debug traces
