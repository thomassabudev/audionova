// This is a placeholder for integration tests
// In a real implementation with proper testing setup, we would test:
// 1. That changing theme mode updates the preview immediately
// 2. That changing accent color updates the preview immediately
// 3. That Save button persists settings to localStorage
// 4. That Reset button reverts preview to saved settings
// 5. That the UI correctly reflects saved vs. preview settings
